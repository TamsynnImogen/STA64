# LUA-05 presentation milestone

`Cineractive`, `Media` and `UI` now queue `Edit::Present` commands from
`PlayerId::SCRIPT`. The sim raises the matching events; these bindings do
not render a shot/title or play a sound/movie themselves.

Call-shape evidence: Immy's clean-room `armada_missions` A2 ports (including
*Along the Neutral Zone*, *Into the Breach* and *UI Tutorial*) and the local
`A2FOMissions/missions/Recovery.lua`. No MMM implementation was copied.

- `Cineractive.active` and `.skippable` are readable/writable booleans.
- `:lookFrom(entity | Vector | Path(name), ...)` retains the source and
  `:lookAt(...)` completes a simple entity/vector pair with a zero-duration
  `Shot`. A new source does not produce a shot toward an earlier target.
  Other requests, including paths and extra arguments, stay generic `Call`
  events without adding an approximate shot. The number seen with paths is not
  interpreted as a duration or speed. `Path` currently keeps only a name.
- `:setCameraOffset(Vector)` produces `CameraOffset(relative=false)`;
  `:fadeIn(seconds)` / `:fadeOut(seconds)` fade from/to black. These are
  explicit bridge defaults. Unobserved overloads return errors.
- `Media:playSound(name)` returns a bridge sound id; `:stopSounds()` stops
  all sounds this runtime requested, in request order. `:playMusic(name)` /
  `:stopMusic()` and `:playMovie(name)` / `:stopMovie()` send typed events.
  Music defaults to looping and movies to skippable/fullscreen; native
  defaults and return-value compatibility have not been verified.
- `UI:addTitle(text)` / `:addSubtitle(text)` send typed titles. The observed
  `(text, x, y, seconds, boolean)` forms send `Call("UI.addTitle" |
  "UI.addSubtitle", [id, text, x, y, seconds, boolean])`. Placement and the
  final boolean are retained without guessing their interpretation. UI
  returns no handle. There is no evidenced title-removal API in this slice.
- Unknown methods retain permissive stubs and increment `unsupported()`;
  malformed calls to implemented methods return Lua errors.

The asset-free intro test drives a real `Sim`, reaches a synthetic first
objective, and replays its recorded presentation commands. It does not run
a full converted stock mission. Remaining LUA-05 gates include the
DLL-named `A2` table, mission-object lifecycle beyond the setup/update bridge,
unverified Timer overloads and other missing MMM APIs, full converted-mission tests, and client-side
presentation/completion feedback. The package remains in progress.
